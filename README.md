To figure out how to cuse the manpage for journalctl to write a journalctl command that does the following:
- print logs for the current boot
- logs should have a priority of warning or more important
- output in a nice pretty json.


To print logs for the current boot, use the option
```
--boot
```

```

This can be found in the man page by search /priority, and you should see this.
